## Introduction

dogsTutorial is a practice package before I let myself loose on a real one!

## Installing dogsTutorial

```{r setup}
library(dogsTutorial)
```

## Functions

dogsTutorial has one function which suggests dogs are better than cats.

```{r example}
dogs_over_cats(agree=TRUE)
dogs_over_cats(agree=FALSE)
```

Of course, as a cat owner, I disagree with this!

## Conclusion

Hoorah, I made my first vignette!
